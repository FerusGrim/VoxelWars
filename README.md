VOXELWARS
=========

Due to circumstances that have no business being discussed on this page, VoxelWars has been discontinued. No, I'm not happy about it. If you want more information, feel free to add me on Skype. You kiddies are knowledgeable enough, I'm sure, to figure out my username.

The goal of this plugin was to create a framework that would allow modularization of Gamemodes and a fluid Command system for registering and managing every command for the server.

Note, that this plugin will no longer be worked upon. Anyone wishing to pick it up is more than willing to, without me. For inquiries about my future projects, feel free to refer to the first paragraph in this README.md.
